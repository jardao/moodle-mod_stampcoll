Stamp collection module
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mudrd8mz/moodle-mod_stampcoll.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mudrd8mz/moodle-mod_stampcoll)

The Stamp collection module allows a teacher to give "stamps" (i.e. picture
with a comment) to students so they collect these stamps. The activity can be
used in many ways, such as motivative bonus marks, absence marks, certification
records etc.

The module uses capabilities to control who can collect stamps and give stamps.
Therefore, student can be allowed to give stamps to other students, the stamps
may be given to teachers etc. Teachers can setup the module to show all stamps
to all students, to show stamps only to the individual student to whom it was
awarded or to hide stamps completely.
